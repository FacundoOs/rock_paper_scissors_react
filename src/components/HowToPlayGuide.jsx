      <h2>Why is Rock Paper Scissors played?</h2>
      <p>
        This game is played by children and adults and is popular all over the
        world. Apart from being a game played to pass time, the game is usually
        played in situations where something has to be chosen. It is similar in
        that way to other games like flipping the coin, throwing dice or drawing
        straws. There is no room for cheating or for knowing what the other
        person is going to do so the results are usually very satisfying with no
        room for fighting or error.

        The outcome of the game is determined by 3 simple rules: Rock wins
        against scissors. Scissors win against paper. Paper wins against rock.
